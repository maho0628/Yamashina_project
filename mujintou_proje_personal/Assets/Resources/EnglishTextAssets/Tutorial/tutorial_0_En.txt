First we have to find a place to sleep...
Find a place where you can shelter from **the wind and rain and use it as a base.
If you can find a large tree, a cave or **a steep cliff, you can use it as a roof.
If we can't find one, we'll have to build one...?
While thinking about this, I walked aimlessly **along the coastline and fortunately found **what looked like a cave.
Let's go in!
