This spacecraft is scheduled to land on the Moon shortly.**In preparation for landing, please place your baggage **in a secure place, such as the upper shelf, **just as you did for takeoff.
The voice was announced by the main AI that **manages the ship's operation.
I put down the guidebook on the Moon that I was reading **and turned to the next side.
There, his wife, with whom he is sharing this space trip, **is looking out the window.
My wife said, “Look how beautiful the earth is. I'm so excited to think that we'll soon have our honeymoon on the moon, **which I've been looking forward to for so long.”
Wife: **“Oh, yes. It was worth all the careful planning we had done for this day.
The spaceship they were on was leaving the shining blue planet for the moon, the setting for their honeymoon.
Today, in the year 2040 A.D., technological advances have made space travel possible with the construction of a space station on the moon.
A spectacular honeymoon that reaches to outer space would be **the perfect opportunity to create a lifetime memory **with the girlfriend you love.
With this in mind, I was about to unwrap my baggage **from the floor and put it in a cabinet.
