When he woke up, he was lying on the beach. **I still have some physical pain, but somehow I seem to be alive.
‘...... this is...?’
Looking around, you can see a forest rich in nature **and a vast ocean. Perhaps this is Earth, and we have crashed **on an island somewhere. There is no sign of life, so it must be what is called an uninhabited island.
On the side is the wreckage of a spaceship. There is no sign of my wife inside or around it. She must have escaped safely using the emergency escape device at that time.
'I wasn't wearing an emergency escape device, but thanks to the fact that I crash-landed in the ocean, I was lucky enough to **make it to the surface. ...... It was a blessing in disguise.’
But I cannot rest easy. But I can't rest easy, because now **I'm lost in a strange land and I don't know when help will come.
...... I don't want to die.’
He looks at the ring on his ring finger and mutters. **I want to see my wife and start our honeymoon all over again.
To do that, I have to survive on this island until help arrives. **Then I can't dawdle. Let's explore this island and find a way **to survive.
