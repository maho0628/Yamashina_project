The time has finally come to use the raft...
I made up my mind to do so yesterday. This morning the skies are clear and the waves are calm, making it a good day for sailing.
We took some food from our base and put it on the handmade raft so that we can survive for a while on the sea.
This sailing is a gamble... If he had waited for help on the island, he might have managed to hang on and survive.
But I have a wife waiting for my return. I must get off this island as soon as possible.
With this in mind, he finally rowed out to sea.
The boat floats awkwardly, but it floats well! The stability is not so bad either.
Using a piece of wood as an oar, I literally struggled through the sea!
Then, when I couldn't even see the island anymore, I suddenly heard the sound of an engine.
...a boat! A ship is running in the sea!
'Ooooh! Here we are! Help me!â€™
He snapped the flag fixed to the raft and waved it wide!
If we miss that ship, we may not make it. Please, please, notice me!
