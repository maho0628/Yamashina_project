    m_Localized: Approach the nest slowly and unnoticed. However, as if sensing our
      movement, the hawk started to descend rapidly! it hurts! ! The nails dug into

    m_Localized: When I threw the yakitori that was in my bag, he didn't miss it
      and started descending. I was able to use this opportunity to run to the nest
